# Placeholder CMakeLists.txt for GLFW
# In a real project, you would download GLFW from https://www.glfw.org/

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(glfw)

add_library(glfw INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(glfw INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

# Note: This is just a placeholder. In a real project, you would need to:
# 1. Download GLFW source files or use find_package(glfw3)
# 2. Add them to the library or link to the system library
# 3. Configure proper compilation settings
