## Overview

MIDI Chord Transformer is a powerful tool that allows musicians and composers to:

1. Load and analyze MIDI files to detect chord structures
2. Transform chords using various techniques (standard transformation, inversions, percentage-based morphing, tonality switching)
3. Apply sophisticated voice leading algorithms for smooth chord transitions
4. Analyze chord progressions and detect musical keys
5. Preview chord transformations with audio synthesis
6. Batch process multiple MIDI files

The application features a modern GUI built with ImGui and GLFW, providing an intuitive interface for all operations.
